Simple Open Source PDF Filler.

Fill-A-Doc is an open source project created to eliminate the scarcity of a simple lightweight tool to fill in pdf fields.
It was created mainly for the purpose of typing text into simple pdf form templates.

Fill-A-Doc is free for use for everyone.

PDF form fields can be created in many softwares and webapps including Open Office Writer With Apache OpenOffice Extensions (Free).
These fields can then be filled using this software.

Open Office has been used during development of this project, a sample .ODG file is available along with it's exported sample .pdf in the sample folder.

Uses iText open source library.

Notes:
change line type to 'singleline' or 'multiline' in open office form control to get the desired effect in Fill-A-Doc.

current version 1.0 only supports TextBox, this may change in future versions.
you can import any pdf in 'Apache Open Office' and add form fields to it by installing an extension named 'PDF Import'.
