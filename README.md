Simple Open Source PDF Filler.

Fill-A-Doc is an open source project created to eliminate the scarcity of a simple lightweight tool to fill in pdf fields.

Fill-A-Doc is free for use for everyone.

PDF form fields can be created in many softwares and webapps including Open Office Writer With Apache OpenOffice Extensions (Free).
These fields can then be filled using this software.

Future plans include creation of form fields directly through Fill-A-Doc itself,
thus removing the limitations of having to relying on third party softwares for such a simple task.

Open Office has been used during development of this project, a sample .ODG file is available along with it's exported sample .pdf in the sample folder.

Uses iText open source library.
